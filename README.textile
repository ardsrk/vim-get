Allowing you to always have the latest version of a bunch of vim plugins

To install, there's a few rake tasks you should know:
@rake preinstall@ Gets the latest on all the plugins
@rake install@ Copies files over to ~/.vim

Also
@rake uninstall@ Deletes ~/.vim
@rake reinstall@ Uninstall, install.

If you want to add another plugin, just edit the plugins.yml file & add the name & url of the source control of the plugin to the SCRIPTS array in the Rakefile.
